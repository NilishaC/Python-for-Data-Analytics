# Python-for-Data-Analytics

The Python for Data Analytics notebooks are in two parts: we expect you to at least attempt all the exercises in part 1. Taken in sequence, these should all be doable. We also advise you to have a go at the exerecises in part 2, however these may prove to be too complicated at this stage and may need to be revisited at a later point.
